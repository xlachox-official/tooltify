Tooltify is a simple batch script made for you by xlachox that installs or removes Spicetify.
There are a few extra functions that the script can perform:

- Install Spicetify
- Install Spicetify Marketplace
- Spicetify update
- Spicetify restore backup
- Spicetify backup apply
- Uninstall Spicetify
- Tooltify Updater

The script is open source, is not a virus, 100% harmless and only does what it should do.
Tooltify comes with the Tooltify Updater. Tooltify Updater will be installed automatically as soon as you install Spicetify with the Tooltify script. Tooltify Updater, once installed, will run automatically as soon as Windows starts. This tool, which is part of Tooltify, ensures that you always have the best experience with Spicetify in Spotify and that Spicetify is always up to date. If Spicetify is not up to date, it may no longer work in Spotify. You can deactivate or activate this function under "Advanced Options" in the Tooltify script.

Tooltify installs a batch file named "tooltify_updater.bat" in "C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" so that Tooltify Updater can run at Windows startup.

Who does not know it? People increasingly want to personalize their virtual interface on the computer. One possibility is to personalize the Spotify program under the Microsoft Windows operating system with the open source tool Spicetify. With Spicetify you can use Power Shell to install a kind of add-on or plugin that is integrated into Spotify. This allows you to set your own themes, block ads and much more that you can install in the Spicetify Marketplace area. However, not everyone knows how to use powershell to install Spicetify. Many people don't even know what powershell is. I have only had good experiences with Spicetify and have repeatedly recommended it to friends. And because many in my circle of friends didn't understand how to do this or had difficulties with powershell, I thought about it and programmed the Tooltify script. It's a simple batch script, but it's very useful, and I've gotten feedback from my friends that it's much easier with the Tooltify script. Not only can Tooltify install Spicetify or update Spicetify automatically using Tooltify Updater, but it can uninstall or install Spotify for Windows 10, 11, 8.1, 8 and even for Windows 7. And I thought to myself, if Tooltify has succeeded so well in private, why Shouldn't I share Tooltify with the world, even if it's a simple batch script? And here I am, writing this article, and I'm happy that I can share Tooltify with you and that I'll be able to introduce you to new features of Tooltify in the future!

Tooltify works thanks to the open source project Spicetify. Tooltify only uses commands that install, update or repair Spicetify. I have not modified the Spicetify file and script and have not published it as my own product. Tooltify only ensures that Spicetify works properly, made for users who don't know much about computers.
